Section 7 - IP Address Classes

Class A - Large networks (Rare)
Range: 1.0.0.0 – 126.255.255.255
First octet range: 1 – 126
Default subnet mask: 255.0.0.0 → /8
Structure:Network.Host.Host.Host
Hosts per network: 16,777,214 hosts
Special: 127.x.x.x = Loopback (used for testing)
Reserved Private Addresses: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Can be assigned to hosts but they are not routable on public internet)
Example: 10.5.2.1


Class B - Medium networks (Sometimes)
Range: 128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255
First octet range: 128 – 191
Default subnet mask: 255.255.0.0 → /16
Structure: Network.Network.Host.Host
Hosts per network: 65,534 hosts
Reserved Private Addresses: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Can be assigned to hosts but they are not routable on public internet)
Example: 172.16.5.4


Class C - Small networks (Very common)
Range: 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255
First octet range: 192 – 223
Default subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 → /24
Structure: Network.Network.Network.Host
Hosts per network: 254 hosts
Reserved Private Addresses: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Can be assigned to hosts but they are not routable on public internet)
Example: 192.168.1.10


Class D - Multicast (Rare)
Range: 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255
Used for multicast (one-to-many communication)
Not used for regular host addressing
Example: 224.0.0.1


Class E - Experimental (Not for normal use)
Range: 240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255
Reserved for research/testing.
Broadcast Address: 255.255.255.255
Not used in normal networks.


Easy Trick to Identify Class
Just look at the first octet:
First Octet	Class
1 – 126	  A    /8     255.0.0.0
128 – 191	B    /16    255.255.0.0
192 – 223	C    /24    255.255.255.0
224 – 239	D
240 – 255	E
