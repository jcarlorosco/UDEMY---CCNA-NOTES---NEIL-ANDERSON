Section 11 - Cisco Device Functions

Hubs and Switches

	Hubs and switches perform a similar function.
	End hosts in a Local Area Network such as PCs, servers and printers plug into them with an Ethernet cable.
	The end hosts can then communicate with each other through the hub or switch.
	
Hubs - Hald Duplex and Shared Collision Domain (Layer 1)

	Hubs operate in half-duplex mode.
	Attached hosts cannot send and receive data at the same time, they can only do one or the other.
	All hosts share the same collision domain - only one device can transmit at a time.
	If two hosts send at the same time a collision will occur.
	Hosts use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to detect collisions and resend.
	
Switches - Full Duplex and Seperate Collision Domains (Layer 2)

	Switches can operate in either full-duplex or half-duplex mode.
	In practice they always operate as full-duplex
	Attached hosts can be both send and receive data at the same time.
	All hosts have their own dedicated collision domain.
	Collision Detection is not required.

| Feature        | Half-Duplex       | Full-Duplex          |
+----------------+-------------------+----------------------+
| Send & Receive | One at a time     | Same time            |
| Collisions     | Yes               | No                   |
| Speed          | Slower            | Faster               |
| Used in        | Hubs, old Ethernet| Switches, modern ETH |

Hubs operate at OSI Layer 1

	Hubs operate at layer 1 of the OSI model.
	They are not MAC Address aware.
	Whenever a fram is received it is flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on.
	All attached hosts must process all packets.
	
Switches operate at OSI Layer 1

	Switches operate at layer 2 of the OSI model.
	They also operate at Layer 1
	They are MAC Address aware.
	
	
================================
 
 Routers (Operate at Layer 3)
 
	Routers know the paths to get to the different IP subnets on a network.
	They are required to send traffic from one subnet to another.
	Routers operate at layer 3 of the OSI Model.
	They also operate at Layers 2 and 1, and will typically have awareness up to layer 7.
	
Routers vs Switches

	Routers are Layer 3 aware and can route between different networks.
	Switches are Layer 2 aware and can switch traffic between hosts on the local are network.
	Routers support many types of interfaces, such as Ethernet, Seriesl, ISDN, ADSL etc.
	Switches typically only support Ethernet interfaces.
	Switches will typically have more ports than routers.
	Switches forward broadcast traffic, routers do not by default.
	
Layer 3 Switches

	Advanced switches are Layer 3 aware and can route traffic between different IP subnets.
	Layer 3 switches will still typically support only Ethernet interfaces and will have more ports than routers.
