Section 10 - OSI Layer 1 - The Physical Layer

OSI Layer 1 - bits
	Conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light or radio signals - through the network at the electrical and mechanical level.
	It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data, including defining cables, interface card and physical aspects.
	
	Ethernet LAN connections can be carried over coaxial cable (no logner used), twisted copper pair cable, fiber cable or wireless.
	Copper UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) cables are commonly used to connect desktop computers to switches.
	Connector type is RJ-45 and maximum length is 100 meters.
	
UTP Cable Categories

Cateroy		Maximum Bandwidth
Cat 5			100 Mbps
Cat 5e			1 Gbps
Cat 6			10 Gbps
Cat 7			10 Gbps
Cat 8			40 Gps

Straight-Throughh vs Crossover UTP Cable

	The receive and transmit wires in a UTP cable can be wired to the RJ-45 connector as either straight-through or crossover.
	Straight-through cables are used to connect an end device such as a PC or router to a switch.
	Crossover cables are used to connect devices together directly. They are most often used to connect two devices of the same type.
	e.g. two computers or two switches to each other.
	Modern switches support Auto MDI-X where the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured automatically to yield the expected result.
	
Fiber Cables

	Fiber optic cables can be used to support longer distances or higher bandwidth requirements.
	For example between separate buildings in a campus, or for switch to switch connections inside a building.
	
Single Mode vs Multi Mode Fiber

	Single Mode or Multi Mode Fiber can be used.
	Single Mode supports higher bandwidth and longer distances but is more expensive.
	
PoE - Power Over Ethernet
