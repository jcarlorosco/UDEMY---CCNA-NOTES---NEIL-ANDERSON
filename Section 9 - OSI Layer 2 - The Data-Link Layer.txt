Section 9 - OSI Layer 2 - The Data-Link Layer

Local Area Network Layer 2 - Ethernet
	Frames are encoded and decoded into bits at layer 2.
	Error detection and correction for the physical layer can be provided here.
	Ethernet is the layer 2 medium used on Local Area Networks.

The Media Access Control MAC Address
	Ethernet uses a 48-bit hexadecimal MAC Address.
	The First 24 bits is the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) which uniquely identifies the manufacturer of the Ethernet port.
	The OUI is assigned by the IEEE.
	The last 24 bits is vendor assigned.
	The burned in MAC Address on every NIC port in the world is globally unique.
	Example - 00:50:56:C0:00:08
	
The 48-bits address space contains potentially 2^48 or 281,474,976,710,656 possible MAC Address.

Ways to get MAC Address to a device
Windows - ipconfig /all > Physical Address
Linux - ifconfig > HWaddr
Cisco Router - enable > show interface > FastEthernet0/0 (BIA - burned in address)
