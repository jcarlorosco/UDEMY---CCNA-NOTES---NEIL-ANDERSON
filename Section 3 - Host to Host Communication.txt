Very basic Introduction to Networking

Endpoint Devices
- Endpoint devices are devices that people use directly on a network.
Examples: Computer (PC or laptop), Smartphone, Printer, Server, etc.
- These devices send and receive data on the network.


Wireless Access Point (WAP)
- A Wireless Access Point (WAP) allows wireless devices (like phones and laptops) to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi.
- It acts like a bridge between wireless devices and the wired network.


Switch
- A switch connects multiple devices inside the same network (usually in a building).
- It works like a smart traffic controller inside a building.


Router
- A router connects different networks together.
- It works like a post office directing mail between cities.


Firewall
- A firewall is a security device or software that protects a network.
- Think of it as a security guard for your network.


LAN (Local Area Network)
- A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that connects devices in a small area.


WAN (Wide Area Network)
- A network that covers a large geographic area.
- WAN connects networks across cities, countries, or even the whole world.
