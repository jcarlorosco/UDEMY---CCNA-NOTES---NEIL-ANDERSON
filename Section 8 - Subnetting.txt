Section 8 - Subnetting

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
	- Removed the fixed /8, /16 and /24 requirements for the address classes.
	- Allowed them to be split or 'subnetted' into smaller networks.
	
Route Summarisation
	- Instead of routing all hosts to other ISP they can be summarized as one
	- ISP A 175.10.0.0 /16 advertise -> 175.10.0.0/24 - 175.10.255.0/24
	- ISP B 175.11.0.0 /16 advertise -> 175.11.0.0/24 - 175.11.255.0/24
	- This reduces the size of ISP A's routing table and takes up less memory.
	- If an individual link goes down in ISP B, it has no impact on ISP A.
	
Subnetting
	- Is the process of dividing a large IP network into smaller, more manageable networks called subnets.
	- Breaking one big network into smaller networks.

IP Address 135.15.10.138 /29

Find the network address: 135.15.10.136
Range of valid Address: 135.15.10.137 - 142

Class A on 4th Octet
60.0.0.0 /8
If we apply the subnet mask 255.255.255.240, how many subnets do we have and how many hosts per subnet?

Answer:
255.255.255.240 subnet mask is /28
14 hosts per network (2^4 - 2) = 4 allocated to host portion, then - 2 for network and broadcast ip
Because we were allocated a Class A /8 address range, we have 20 bits for network addresses
This allows 1,048,576 subnets (2^20) (Given /8 - /28)

For IP Address 60.15.10.75 /28, what is the network address, broadcast address and range of valid IP address?

Network Address: 60.15.10.64
Range of valid address: 60.15.10.65 - .78
Broadcast address: 60.15.10.79
Next network address: 60.15.10.80

--

Class A on 3rd Octet
60.0.0.0 /8
Subnet to /19 255.255.224.0
2^13 (13 bits remaining for host) - 2 = 8190 hosts per network
2^11 ( (/8 - /19) = 11 bits for network addresses) = 2048 subnets

60.15.10.75 /19 - 32i
Network Address: 60.15.0.0
Range of valid address: 60.15.0.1 - 60.15.31.254
Broadcast address: 60.15.31.255
Next network address: 60.15.32.0

Subnetting Large Networks

Subnet the 134.65.0.0 network into six different networks
what subnet mask do you use?

3 bits would provide 8 subnets (2^3)

default subnet is /16
Convert 6 = 3 bits
Add to default /16 + 3 = /19
Increment = /19 = 32i

134.65.0.0
134.65.32.0
134.65.64.0
134.65.96.0 .... etc

Each subnet (2^13 - 2) = 8190 Hosts (Remaining host portion)

Private IP Addresses

RFC 1918 Private Address

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) documents standards with RFC's (Requests For Comments)
RFC 1918 specifies private IP address ranges which are not routable on the public internet.

Range of private addresses in each address class

Class A private address
10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
10.0.0.0 /8
10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0

Class B private address
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
172.16.0.0 /12
172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0

Class C private address
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
192.168.0.0 /16
192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0

Today;s Networks

Most enterprises today use RFC 1918 IPv4 addresses with NAT (Network Address Translation).
RFC 1918 has the security benefit of hiding inside hosts by default (they don't have a publicly routable IP Address)
plus network engineers have more experience with IPv4 than v6.
